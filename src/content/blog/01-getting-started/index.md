Summer vacations to cubicle. Time is flying that fast for me. I don't know where all the time went. Like damn bro I'm 27 now. Shit is crazy. I used to look at people this age and htnknthatue close to 30. Now that's me. The tables have turned baby and I don't want to sit at this fucking table no more. Shit is ass. Taxes, jobs. Give me the school again. I just know when I die and I get to watch the replay of my life, I am going to be pissed because of how much time I just wasted in my 20s. I first want to acknowledge that I'm not complaining, or airing out my concerns. I am old fashioned BITCHING! Every once in a while we don't just need to rant we need to BITCH! My life is good and I have no complains. for the record. Looking back is fun because everything is in perspective. At least some of it. I get to understand some of what my parents were saying now that I'm older. Theyu had me a 20 wh;;cih is wild to think about because I was fully reateard and the age of 29 and I'm 27. It is a blessing to get older though seeing a lof of young kids not make it to this age is sacaytl whereht i be drugs or violence I anca complain;
