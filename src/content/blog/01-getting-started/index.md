# Where the fuck does the time go? 

I swear getting older is weird. Like I don't even feel like 27. Maybe physically I do. Kinda sad. But mentally I still feel at least 24. There's just no way time flew that fast. I still have no clue of what I want to do with life. Or what even direction I want to go in. I don't even know how I got here fr. Kind of like when you're driving home from work and your body is just on autopilot. Shit is crazy.

I did learn a lot I guess. Getting older does put tthings into perspective for you. LIke my parents had me at 20. I was fucking retarded at 20. Now I'm 27 and now I feel like I can handle a kid. I was talking to my cousing yesterday. Me and him are the same age, and we were talking about this too. 2015 is when we graduated highschool. IT IS NOW 2025. A whole decade bro, just gone. Sure I had a lot of good memories that I wouldn't give up but holy shit. Time doesn't give a fuck about anybody. 

My brother is 10 years younger than me right? He's about to graduate highschool and go into college. I am about to get married. Like time is just weird, but oddly satisfying when you look at the grand scheme of things.
