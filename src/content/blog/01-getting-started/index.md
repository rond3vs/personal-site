# Where the fuck does the time go? 

I swear getting older is weird. Like I don't even feel like 27. Maybe physically I do. Kinda sad. But mentally I still feel at least 24. There's just no way time flew that fast. I still have no clue of what I want to do with life. Or what even direction I want to go in. I don't even know how I got here fr. Kind of like when you're driving home from work and your body is just on autopilot. Shit is crazy.

I did learn a lot I guess. Getting older does put tthings into perspective for you. LIke my parents had me at 20. I was fucking retarded at 20. Now I'm 27 and now I feel like I can handle a kid.
